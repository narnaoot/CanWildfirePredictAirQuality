# Project Report 

## Project Proposal

* Phase 1:  Use linear regression to predict Bay area air quality on the final day of a fire with a given number of acres consumed.
* Phase 2: (if time allows) -- Add wind speed to the picture for multi-factor linear regression.

## Answers to Questions

Team:  me
Technologies used:
* Sci-Kit learn
* Pandas dataframes
* MySQL database
* Optional: Flask site deployed to heroku (to display results)

Timeline:
* 2/28: Project definition, data preprocessing
* 3/2 & 3/5: Linear regression (acreage and air quality only)
* 3/7 & 3/9: Figure out how to display data, deploy site
* 3/11 & 3/14: If time allows, add in wind speed for multi-factor regression.
